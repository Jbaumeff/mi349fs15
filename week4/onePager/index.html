      <h1>Jeff Baum's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Short Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        One portfolio that contains all the different projects and applications Jeff Baum has been a part of or has created.
      </p>

      <h2>Long Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        Although the site doesn’t have an official name yet, the site will display all of Jeff Baum’s projects and applications.  The site will be a great place for recruiters to come and see all of Jeff’s works in one place. Jeff doesn’t currently have job, but the site should be able to change in a way that expresses Jeff’s current availability in terms of employment.
